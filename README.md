# Chemodynamical Ages of Small-Scale Kinematic Structures of the Galactic Disc in the Solar Neighborhood

This repository hosts the code to prepoduce the analysis and figures in the paper "Chemodynamical Ages of Small-Scale Kinematic Structures of the Galactic Disc in the Solar Neighborhood" by Ilija Medan and Sebastien Lepine. The full analysis for the paper can be rerun using `full_paper_analysis.ipynb` after downloading the external catalogs mentioned in the notebook. This notebook utlizes the main code in `gm_age_relation.py`. The requriments to run the code are also included in `requirments.txt`.
