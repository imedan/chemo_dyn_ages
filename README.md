# Chemodynamical Ages of Small-Scale Kinematic Structures of the Galactic Disc in the Solar Neighborhood

This repository hosts the code to prepoduce the analysis in the paper "[Chemodynamical Ages of Small-Scale Kinematic Structures of the Galactic Disc in the Solar Neighborhood from ~280,000 K and M Dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11331)" by Ilija Medan and Sebastien Lepine. The full analysis for the paper can be rerun using `paper_analysis.py` after downloading the external catalogs mentioned in the comments of the code. This script utlizes the main code in `gm_age_relation.py`. The main output of the code (i.e. the age and birth radii dsitrbutions) are located in the `age_grid_kde/` directory. These files are numpy arrays saved to a binary file in NumPy `.npy` format (for more information, see [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.lib.format.html#module-numpy.lib.format)). The requriments to run the code are also included in `requirments.txt`.
