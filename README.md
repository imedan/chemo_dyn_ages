# Chemodynamical Ages of Small-Scale Kinematic Structures of the Galactic Disc in the Solar Neighborhood

This repository hosts the code to prepoduce the analysis in the paper "Chemodynamical Ages of Small-Scale Kinematic Structures of the Galactic Disc in the Solar Neighborhood from ~280,000 K and M Dwarfs" by Ilija Medan and Sebastien Lepine. The full analysis for the paper can be rerun using `paper_analysis.py` after downloading the external catalogs mentioned in the comments of the code. This script utlizes the main code in `gm_age_relation.py`. The requriments to run the code are also included in `requirments.txt`.
